CMPS 109 Fall 2016: Assignment 1 
Assigned: Thursday, October 29 in Class 

Due: Tuesday, October 11 at 13:00 
 

Delayed submission with penalty until Friday 14 October mid-night 

 
Goals 

The goal of the assignment is to traverse the different functionalities and 
features of the C++ language, and to be able to identify the difference between 
different versions of the C++ language. C++ was subject to an evolution process 
that resulted in different incremental versions starting with C++98. This 
assignment is more like a research task, and you are asked to write a survey 
paper that identifies such differences. The objective is to urge you to read ahead 
about the new features in C++11/14 and study them so when you attend the 
lectures you are familiar with the concepts.  
 

Details 

Conduct a comparison between the different C++ versions: C++98, C++11, 
C++14,C++17. Consider the C++98 as the base for your comparison and start 
enumerating newly added features inclemently in each version starting from 
C++11. You are expected to present at least: 
1. 	6 Features for C++11 
2. 	4 Features for C++14 
3. 	2 Expected Features for C++17 
 
This is the minimum, and it is advisable to present more features so you can 
make up for mistakes in your survey. Also you will be required to provide simple 
examples for each feature you present (only for C++11 and C++14); very small 
snippets of code but need to be of your own. IMPORTANT: do not present 
examples from lectures slides or from the web, e.g. cppreference.com. 
 

What to submit 

1. 	A report that enumerate the features. Each feature should have paragraph 
	explaining it clearly and the benefits entailed, as well as an example 
	showing such benefits. 
2. 	Your report should be submitted in PDF format. 
3. 	The set of C++ examples you develop during your survey research in 
	source code. 
4. 	Source code should have inline documentation. 
5. 	Each example should be located in a file with the following format: 
	example<Example Number>_c_plus_plus_<C++ Version>.cpp, the same 
	format should be applied to .h files. 
6. 	In your report, include a reference section for any sources you have used 
	in your survey (Bibliography). 
 

How to submit: 

The git repo is now ready for you to checkout. Use this tutorial at 
https://git.soe.ucsc.edu/ ̃git/index.html to setup your repo local version. Include 
everything under the folder hw1. Include your code in a separate directory and 
call it “Code”; inside hw1. 
 
Keep on updating your repository as many times as you need, and when you are 
confident of your submission, submits the commit Id of the desired version to 
the ecommons. 
 

Grade 

This assignment is worth 5% of the overall course grade. The assignment will be 
graded on a 100% grade scale, and then will be scaled down to the 5% its worth. 
The grading of the assignment will be broken down as follows: 

1. 	10% for just submitting a meaningful assignment before or on the due 
	date. A submission that contains report and code i.e. if you just submitted 
	an empty assignment you will get nothing. This 10% does not account for 
	the correctness of your assignment. 
2. 	50% for the report. This will account for the correctness of the content of 
	the survey, and how you present the information. 
3. 	40% for the code examples correctness and inline documentation. 
 

Delays 

You have up to 4 working days of delay, after which the assignment will not be 
accepted and your grade in that case will be ZERO. For every day (of the 4 
allowed days), a penalty of 10% will be deducted from the grade. And of course 
you will lose the 10% mentioned in point 1 above under the “Grade” section.
